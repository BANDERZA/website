           <b><u>Week 1</u></b>
            <ul class="text1">
             <li >We spent the first week brainstorming ideas for our project in groups around the topic of wellbeing and health</li>  

             <li >I like walking so I decided to research walking and any possible benefits for human health, and I found lots of source and facts for example that walking for half an hour a day can improve mental health, I think this would be a great thing to incorporate into a device as a daily  goal the user has achieved and I could incorporate some sort of notification system.</li>   
            </ul>
            </p>
        
       <p class="text1">
             
        <b><u>Week 2</u></b>
           <ul class="text1">
            <li >By the start of week 2 I decided that I would create a pedometer with a built-in calorie counter that counts the calories of the wearer on the go, a pedometer is a device that counts the number of steps you have taken by detecting the motion of your body. </li>
            <li >I constructed a survey on Microsoft forms and emailed the survey to fellow students in my school on factors related to extra walking per day such as stress levels and I also asked participants if they would like to see any other features </li>
            <li >After researching pedometers online and looking at multiple designs such as the waist wrist and thigh designs, I decided to go for the ankle pedometer design where the device is placed on the leg of walker, I feel like this would be best for micro bit because of how small it is and because it will be easier for the micro bit to detect. </li>
            <li >After waiting a few days for answers and results after launching my survey I did see some interesting requests for extra features for my pedometer such as finding the distance travelled, I would definitely like to incorporate this somehow into it, but I would only be able to give an estimated value for distance as a more accurate value for distance would require an extra input by the user such as height and weight making my project no longer autonomous and I would be unable to meet my basic requirements. </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="text1">
            <b><u>Week 3</u></b>
            <ul class="text1">
                <li >For my code I decided to use the “on shake” function/block in the micro bit however my teacher said that the micro bit would count steps more accurately if the steps were counted with the acceleration strength, I was not sure of this, so I decided to test  run two codes on the micro bit  and check the accuracy for myself .</li>
                <li>For testing both methods I created two codes for counting steps, one where the acceleration function is used and one where the “on shake” block/function was used, then I fixed the micro bit to my ankle with tape. I walked with the micro bit while counting my steps and after compared the number of steps taken to steps counted by each set of code. </li>
                
            </ul>
       
        </p>
        <p class="text1">
            <b><u>Week 4</u></b>
            <ul class="text1">
                <li> I ran the same test with both codes on friends and found that measuring the acceleration strength to count steps is a much more effective and consistent way of counting steps rather than using shake in most cases </li>
                <li>I decided to go forward the idea of using the shake function  </li>
                <li>For calorie counting I found that on average per step 0.04 calories are burned for walking so multiplying our counted steps will give us the total calories burned </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="text1">
            <b><u>Week 5</u></b>
            <ul class="text1">
                <li>Mid-term Break</li>
                
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="text1">
            <b><u>Week 6</u></b>
            <ul class="text1">
                <li>To complete my basic requirements, I have added code to predict the calories burned and then I added code to log the data into a table that later will be stored as a csv file and called on by the python code I will write for my advanced requirements if I choose to use my own data, I also added  a notification for if the user has walked for more than 30 min   the coding for my micro bit is finished. </li>
                <li>I finished my flow chart detailing how my code functions, how it receives data (acceleration strength) and outputs data (calories counted). </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="text1">
            <b><u>Week 7-10</u></b>
            <ul class="text1">
                <li>I finished my architecture diagram detailing the overall function of pedometer and basic requirements. I now must finish my advanced requirements  </li>
                <li>For my advanced requirements I am going to be modelling my own data with five parameters “sex”,” mood after the walk", "mood before the walk”,” weight in kgs,” “height in cm.” I am going to be using ChatGPT to generate random data in each of these parameters. </li>
                <li>I also created python code to collect data in all 5 parameters so I could add my own data so users of my pedometer could come to the code and input their data and then the code will take that data and put it in a csv file. I then created a second set of code to read the csv file so I could manipulate the data and create my what if questions. </li>
                <li>Just doing my advanced requirements learning how to read and write into csv files and create graphs using python was a learning experience in and of itself because I feel as though I have learned a lot. </li>
               
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="text1">
            <b><u>Week 11-12</u></b>
            <ul class="text1">
                <li>Finished off my report and html for website. </li>
                
            </ul>

<p class="text1">The code above is important as it is the code that takes the data from my csv file and converts it into a graphical format I created 6 graphs and 4 of them were used to predict outcomes in my what if questions.Also it calculates the slopes for the three linear regressions and prints them on the shell
